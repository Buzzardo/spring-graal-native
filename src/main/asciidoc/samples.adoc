== Samples

There are numerous samples in the `spring-graal-native-samples` subfolder of the root project.
These show the feature in use with different technologies.

The samples don't all currently use maven.
Instead they are built for us to play around with a little more easily.
Each includes a `build.sh` script which (java) builds the app, then calls the `compile.sh` script to run the native-image process then a `verify.sh` script is used to check the built image works.

Our build process for the feature currently runs `./build.sh` in the root of the project and then `./build-samples.sh` to build all the samples and verify everything is working. 
Building native-images takes quite a long time and eats RAM.

The samples show the wide variety of tech that is working fine: tomcat, netty, thymeleaf, jpa, etc, there is even a petclinic in there that brings multiple technologies together in one app.
